# Agent Pipeline and LSP Guardrails

## Why this exists

Agents are fast but drift when constraints are only tribal knowledge. This repo now keeps constraints in both:

1. Human-readable instructions (`AGENTS.md` + module-level `AGENTS.md`)
2. Machine-enforced checks (`npm run check:repo-standards`)

## Enforced checks

`npm run check:repo-standards`

Current rules (diff-aware):
- New source files cannot exceed 300 lines.
- Modified source files cannot cross from <=300 lines to >300 lines.
- New module directories under `packages/` must include `AGENTS.md`.

CI now runs this check on every PR/push through `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## LSP reality (important)

TypeScript/IDE LSP alone cannot reliably enforce architectural rules like "max 300 LOC" or "module must include AGENTS.md".

Use LSP for:
- Type errors
- symbol navigation
- refactor safety

Use repo checks + CI for:
- file-size limits
- folder/module policy
- cross-file architectural contracts

Current editor baseline lives at `/Users/sero/projects/browser-ai/.vscode/settings.json`:
- Biome is the default formatter for JS/TS.
- Code actions are configured for Biome fix/import organization on save.

## Recommended local workflow for agents

1. Read root `/Users/sero/projects/browser-ai/AGENTS.md`.
2. If touching a feature module, read that module's local `AGENTS.md` first.
3. Run:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run check:repo-standards`
   - `npm run build`
4. For broad changes, run `npm run check:all`.

## Evolving standards safely

When adding a new rule:
1. Add it to `scripts/check-repo-standards.mjs`.
2. Document it in this file.
3. Keep it diff-aware first (avoid blocking pre-existing debt).
4. Promote to full-repo enforcement once debt is reduced.
