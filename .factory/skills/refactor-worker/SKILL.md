# Refactor Worker

NOTE: Startup and cleanup are handled by `worker-base`. This skill defines the WORK PROCEDURE.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this worker for refactoring features that involve:
- Consolidating duplicate code
- Splitting large files into smaller modules
- Extracting shared types and utilities
- Simplifying complex logic
- Unifying patterns across the codebase

## Work Procedure

### 1. Understand the Feature Scope

Read the feature description carefully. Identify:
- Which files need to be refactored
- What behavior must be preserved
- Any dependencies on other features

### 2. Establish Baseline

Before making changes:
```bash
# Run all unit tests (NOTE: --grep filters are ignored by the current test runner)
npm run test:unit

# Check current file sizes
wc -l <files-to-refactor>

# Run typecheck
npm run typecheck
```

Document any pre-existing test failures or issues.

**IMPORTANT**: The unit test runner (`tests/unit/run-unit-tests.ts`) hard-codes suite registration and ignores CLI grep filters. To test specific functionality, add a focused test suite that tests exactly what you need.

### 3. Plan the Refactoring

- Identify what can be extracted into separate modules
- Determine the new file structure
- Plan the interfaces between modules
- Consider: Will this break any imports in other files?

### 4. Write Tests First (TDD)

If tests don't exist for the code being refactored:
1. Write tests that capture current behavior
2. Run tests to ensure they pass
3. Then proceed with refactoring

If tests exist:
1. Run them to ensure they pass
2. Update imports if needed during refactoring
3. Keep tests passing throughout

### 5. Refactor Incrementally

Make small, focused changes:
1. Extract one module at a time
2. Run tests after each extraction
3. Run typecheck after each extraction
4. Commit logical units

### 6. Verify File Size Limits

After refactoring:
```bash
# Check all affected files are <= 200 lines
wc -l <affected-files>

# If any file is over 200 lines, continue splitting
```

### 7. Update Imports

Ensure all imports are updated:
1. Files that import from refactored modules
2. Export statements in new modules
3. Index files if applicable

### 8. Final Validation and Diff Review

```bash
# Full typecheck
npm run typecheck

# Run all related tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Lint check
npm run lint

# Repo standards check (file size limits, etc.)
npm run check:repo-standards

# Build check
npm run build

# Final diff review - check what files will be committed
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --stat
```

**CRITICAL - Final Diff Review Checklist:**

Before marking the feature complete, verify:

1. **NO version bumps in package.json or manifest files** - unless the feature is explicitly about release/versioning
2. **ALL touched files are ≤ 200 lines** - this includes test files, config files, and source files
3. **Only relevant files staged** - no accidental changes to unrelated files
4. **All validation steps passed** - typecheck, lint, repo-standards, build

**If version bumps are detected:**
- Unstage them: `git reset HEAD package.json packages/extension/manifest*.json`
- Or commit with `--no-verify` to bypass auto-bumping hooks

**If any file exceeds 200 lines:**
- Split it into smaller focused modules before committing

**IMPORTANT**: Only set `followedProcedure: true` in the handoff if ALL validation steps were actually run and passed. Record the actual commands and their output in the handoff.

### 9. Document Changes

Update any affected:
- Inline documentation
- Type annotations
- README sections if architecture changed

## Example Handoff

```json
{
  "salientSummary": "Refactored panel-core.ts (1541 lines) into 6 focused modules: trace-sanitizer.ts (89 lines), history-manager.ts (112 lines), message-processor.ts (145 lines), state-manager.ts (98 lines), event-handler.ts (134 lines), and panel-core.ts (167 lines). All tests pass, typecheck clean, build succeeds.",
  "whatWasImplemented": "Split panel-core.ts into 6 modules with clear responsibilities. Extracted trace sanitization logic, history management, message processing, state management, and event handling into separate files. Updated all imports in sidepanel UI. Added unit tests for trace-sanitizer.ts and history-manager.ts.",

## When to Return to Orchestrator

Return to the orchestrator if:

1. **Pre-existing test failures** block your refactoring (not caused by your changes)
2. **Circular dependencies** discovered that require architectural decisions
3. **Scope creep** - the refactoring requires changes beyond the feature description
4. **Breaking changes** required that affect external interfaces
5. **Cannot achieve 200 line limit** without losing functionality
6. **Dependencies missing** - needed packages or services unavailable

## Refactoring Principles

1. **Preserve behavior first** - functionality must not change
2. **Small steps** - refactor incrementally, test frequently
3. **Extract, don't rewrite** - move code, don't reimplement
4. **Clear module boundaries** - each module has one responsibility
5. **Explicit dependencies** - inject dependencies, don't hide them
6. **Document intent** - add comments explaining why, not what
